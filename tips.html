<h1>Basic Tips for beginners</h1>
<ol class="a">
  <li>  <strong>Comfortable stance-</strong>
  A comfortable stance is recommended because if you're not comfortable when you shoot you will not shoot well.
   Repeating your stance each time you move will help because the more you practice in the same stance the better you will do.
</li>

  <li><strong>Keep cheek on stock-</strong> Keeping your cheek firmly pressed against the stock is a must. The slightest move will change your focal point and you will shoot in a different spot than you think you are aiming.
    Also, if your head is lifted even a little you can injure yourself from the recoil of the shot.
 </li>
    <li> <strong> Focus on bottom edge of the target-</strong> Very rarely will you shoot too far under the bird 9/10 times you will shoot over or behind the bird.</li>
    <li> <strong>   Prepare for the most severely angled target-</strong> Doing this will put you in the best position to hit the bird.
      Preparing for the hardest bird will make it as easy as all of the other angles that will be thrown.
 </li>
      <li> <strong> Put muzzle way ahead of the target-</strong> If your bead is placed on the bird you will most likely shoot behind the bird because it is moving faster than it looks. It is very rare to shoot in front of the bird and miss.
        Putting the muzzle in front of the bird prevents shooting behind the bird.
</li>
        <li> <strong>Hold the gun slightly below horizontal to see the bird quicker-</strong>The faster you see the target the more time you have to move your gun to the target. </li>
        <li> <strong>Mount the gun to the cheek and not to the shoulder-</strong> By mounting the gun to your cheek instead of your shoulder; your head will be in a better position sitting on the stock of the gun for better aim. </li>
</ol>

<p>
Notice all of the basic tips are applied in this video.
   No one moves from their stances, guns are mounted to the cheek, the guns that are seen are horizontal to the trap house.
   Also station 5 shooter is angled more towards the right because a hard right bird will be harder to shoot.</p></blockquote>
