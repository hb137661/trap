  Trapshooting has been around for many years and is a great sport to get into. Trap is a humbling sport; you have to have a clear mind to be able to shoot correctly.
     If you don’t follow the basic tips for shooting you will not be able to do well because the little things matter. Trap is a growing sport for both males and females.

   <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
   <ol>
     <li>In 2017, Davenport Youth Trap Club launched <strong>36,700</strong> clay birds total, and broke <strong>24,870</strong> of them <strong>(68% team avg.)</strong></li>
     <li>Trapshooting was originally developed, in part, to augment bird hunting and to provide a method of practice for bird hunters.
        Use of targets was introduced as a replacement for live pigeons. Indeed, one of the names for the targets used in shooting games is clay pigeons.
         The layout of a modern trapshooting field differs from that of a skeet field and/or a sporting clays course.
        Now people seek for it to take bird huntings place so there willl be zero bird hunters</li>
        <li>Trapshooting originated in England in the late 18th century</li>
        <li>Modern birds, or clay pigeons, are 4.25 inches in diameter and 1.12
          inches in thickness and are made of pitch and clay or limestone, weighing 3.5–4 ounces. </li>
        <li>If using a radar speed gun to set targets, a speed of 42mph at a target height of 9 feet to 10 feet
          (measured 30 feet out from the trap house center) should reach the desired distance.</li>
